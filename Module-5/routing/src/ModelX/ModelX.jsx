        The Tesla Model X is a mid-size all-electric luxury crossover utility
        vehicle (CUV) made by Tesla, Inc.. The vehicle is unique in the concept
        that it uses gull-wing doors instead of traditional automotive doors.
        The prototype was unveiled at Tesla's design studios in Hawthorne on
        February 9, 2012. The Model X has an official EPA rated 237–295
        mi (381–475 km) range and the combined fuel economy equivalent
        and energy consumption for the AWD P90D was rated at 89 mpg‑e (39
        kW⋅h/100 mi). The Model X was developed from the full-sized sedan
        platform of the Tesla Model S. The Model X has an EPA Size Class as an
        SUV, and shares ~30% of its content with the Model S, half of the
        originally planned ~60%, and weighs about 10 percent more, both are
        being produced at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California. First
        deliveries of the Model X began in September 2015. After one full
        year on the market, the Model X ranked in 2016 seventh among the world's
        best-selling plug-in cars. Global cumulative sales since inception
        totaled 106,689 units through September 2018.
