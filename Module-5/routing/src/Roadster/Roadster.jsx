        The Tesla Roadster is an upcoming all-electric battery-powered
        four-seater sports car made by Tesla, Inc. Tesla has said it will be
        capable of 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in 1.9 seconds, quicker than any
        street legal production car to date at its announcement in November
        2017. The Roadster is the successor to Tesla's first production car,
        which was the 2008 Roadster. Tesla indicates that Roadster sales will
        begin in 2020, although not before the Tesla Model Y goes on sale. Elon
        Musk has said that higher-performance trim levels will be available
        beyond the base specifications.
