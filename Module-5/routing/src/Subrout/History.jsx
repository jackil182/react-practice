        The Model S was styled by Franz von Holzhausen, who previously worked
        for Mazda North American Operations. The car was codenamed WhiteStar
        during research and preliminary development. It was officially
        announced in a press release on June 30, 2008. The prototype
        vehicle was displayed at a press conference on March 26, 2009.
        Exclusive premier of their Model S electric car was held at their Menlo
        Park store on April 8, 2009. In February 2008 it was reported that
        Tesla, Inc. (then Tesla Motors) was planning to offer a range-extended
        version of its Model S. This version would have included a gasoline
        engine to extend the driving range of the vehicle, but it was
        removed in later revisions. At the GoingGreen conference in September
        2008 Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, announced that Tesla was developing only
        electric cars.
